Your Task:
Write a Python script that:

Takes this "messy" list:
raw_guests = ["  alice", "BOB  ", "  chArLie ", "daisy", "  EVE"]

Creates a new list called clean_guests.

For each name in the list:

Strip away the extra whitespace.

Capitalize only the first letter (e.g., "BOB" becomes "Bob").

Print the final clean_guests list.

Hint for Beginners:
Inside your loop, you'll want to use two very helpful "string methods":

.strip() removes spaces from the beginning and end.

.capitalize() makes the first letter uppercase and the rest lowercase.

Bonus (If you're feeling fancy):
Can you make the script print a personalized message for each guest, like "You are invited, Alice!"?

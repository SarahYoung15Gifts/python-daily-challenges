The Scenario:
You are auditing a small warehouse. You have a dictionary of items and their current stock levels. You need to identify which items are low in stock (less than 10 units) and which are out of stock (0 units).

Your Task:

Use this dictionary:
inventory = {"Apples": 50, "Bananas": 5, "Cherries": 0, "Dates": 20, "Eggplant": 8}

Loop through the dictionary.

Print a specific message based on the stock:

If stock is 0, print: "Cherries is OUT OF STOCK!"

If stock is less than 10, print: "Eggplant is low on stock (8 remaining)."

Otherwise, do nothing.

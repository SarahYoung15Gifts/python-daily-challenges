Let's combine everything you've learned: Loops, Strings, Conditionals, and Booleans. We are going to build a basic security check.

The Scenario:
You are creating a sign-up page. You need to make sure the user's password meets specific "strength" criteria before it's accepted.

Your Task:
Write a script that asks a user to input a password and checks it against these three rules:

It must be at least 8 characters long.

It must contain at least one number.

It must contain at least one exclamation mark (!).

Requirements:

If the password passes all three, print: "Password secure!"

If it fails any rule, print: "Password too weak!"

Hint for Beginners:

Use len(password) to check the length.

To check for a number or a "!", you can use the any() function with a loop, or a simple for loop with a boolean flag (a variable set to False that switches to True if the condition is met).

Example of checking for a character: if "!" in password:
